# OpenTextbot

OpenTextbot is the NLP library for different tasks. The main goal of our work is to create the technology for deep semantic analysis and synthesis of text including conversational AI. Our main idea is to take ready vectors of top language models (BERT - 29.12.2019) as basis and create our own superstructure to get really powerful anthropomorphic NLP models.  

Today using OpenTextbot you can:

 - compress token vectors with Compressor;
 
 - make superfast vector lookup with Voronoi;
 
 - make different algebraic operations with vectors using Algebra;
 
 - try your own bot using TestHTML;
 
 - make BERT work with word vectors, not with token vectors using WordBERT;


You can read about OpenTextbot and release decisions in our [original blog](https://textbot.org/).

## Usage

This repository is meant to be a starting point for researchers and engineers to experiment with OpenTextbot.

### Some caveats

- OpenTextbot is to show you our approach to solving main NLP problems, it is not an AI product.

- OpenTextbot is developed only by me, Nikita Nikitin, for TextbotAI team results see [TextbotAI repo github](https://github.com/TextbotAI).

### Work with us

Please [let us know](mailto:mail@textbot.org) if youâ€™re doing interesting research with or working on applications of Textbot AI! 

## Future work

We may release code for evaluating the models on various benchmarks.

We update the code almost every day.
